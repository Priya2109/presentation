FONGo
Fake mongo
In-Memory
Fongo + Untestable -> Testable.
Fongo + Testable -> Better.
“Fongo is an in-memory java implementation of MongoDB. It intercepts calls to the standard mongo-java-driver for finds, updates, inserts, removes and other methods. The primary use is for lightweight unit testing where you don't want to spin up a mongod process.”

Fongo doesn't implement all MongoDB functionality.
Thread safe.
Essentially a big hash map storage instead of DB files.

Unit Tests : Fast,Isolated,Repeateable, self-verifying, timely
